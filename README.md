# space-SHMUP-prototype

  For my shmup I wanted to create a shmup that simulates the battle between fungi vs fungi and fungi vs bacteria. I was inspired by 2 person shmups and wanted to add more factors to the play style of player vs player. I also like to study biology and how different species have developed mechanisms to survive and defeat others. So for this simulation players will be playing as fungi and they will shoot projectiles that will harm the other player or create a child fungi. The child fungi will also be shooting at the opponent (and children) but at a fixed rate. There will also be randomly spawned bacteria that will chase the players and attack them and their children, much like in real life. The player can win by depleting the other player of their health and destroying the opponent's fungi children along with surviving the bacteria invasion. I was also inspired by popular .io games such as agar.io where players grow their sizes to consume other players. In a way my shmup will similuate propagation of fungi but through absobing other players by destroying them. 

So far the prototype is created by following the example from Introduction to Game Design, Protyping, and Development.
